# Repository Name

This repository contains a script that sets up an Apache HTTP server and downloads and deploys web files from a specific GitHub repository. The script is intended to be run on a Linux system using Bash.

## Prerequisites

- Linux-based operating system (tested on CentOS)
- Bash shell
- Internet connectivity to download web files from GitHub

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository directory:

   ```shell
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. Make the script executable:

   ```shell
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```

4. Modify the script if needed, to specify the correct GitHub repository URL or any other parameters.

   This will update the system, install Apache HTTP server, download the web files from the specified GitHub repository, and deploy them to the server's web directory. The script will also start the HTTP server.

6. Access the web server by entering your server's IP address or domain name into a web browser.
